# Health Data Universal API (HDU API)

Welcome to the **HDU API Documentation**.

The Health Data Universal API (HDU API) provides a standardized and secure way to **exchange health data** between different systems such as **Electronic Medical Records (EMRs), Electronic Health Records (EHRs), laboratory systems, and shared health record repositories**.

This documentation is designed to help developers, system integrators, and health information managers understand how to connect, send, and retrieve health data using the HDU API.

---

## Objectives
- Enable **interoperability** between multiple health systems.
- Provide **standardized API messages** and formats for data exchange.
- Ensure **data quality, security, and compliance** with health standards.
- Support **scalable integration** across health facilities.

---

## Who Should Use This Documentation?
- **Developers** → to implement the API in EMR/EHR and lab systems.
- **System Analysts** → to understand architecture, use cases, and workflows.
- **Health IT Administrators** → to manage integration and monitor data flows.

---

## How to Navigate
This documentation is organized into chapters:

- **Chapter 1 – Use Cases** → Architecture, workflows, and interacting systems.
- **Chapter 2 – Data Exchange Specifications** → API messages, templates, and standardized codes.
- **Chapter 3 – Client Registry** → Saving and retrieving client information.
- **Chapter 4 – Shared Health Records** → Managing shared records between systems.
- **Chapter 5 – Laboratory Data** → Exchanging lab data securely.
- **HTTP Error Codes** → Common errors and responses.
